# us-web
This is the repository of the **Universal Webserver** itself, which is a multi-domain, multi-virtual host webserver integrating various services:
 * log generation and rotation, and, if enabled, log analysis made available through a "meta" website
 * TLS certificate use and renewal (soon)
 
The US webserver depends on [us-common](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/us-common/), and may be used with or without [us-web](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/us-web/).
