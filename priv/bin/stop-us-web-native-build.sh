# Implementation notes:

# To stop US-Web, we only have to know the target host (which is here the local
# one), the node name ('us_web' here) and the right cookie and EPMD port, which
# requires thus to find and read the relevant US (not US-Web) configuration
# file. For that we rely our helper shell scripts, and thus we have to locate
# the right US-Web installation as a first move.


# We use a dedicated stop client rather than pipes, as currently pipes are found
# unresponsive:
#
# $ to_erl /tmp/launch-erl-1258957
#Attaching to /tmp/launch-erl-1258957 (^D to exit)
#
#^L

# And no entered command is managed (only Ctrl-C and Ctrl-D work), although the
# TERM environment variable was set before run_erl and to_erl.

usage="Usage: $(basename $0) [${kill_empd_opt}] [US_CONF_DIR]: stops a US-Web server, running as a native build, based on a US configuration directory specified on the command-line (which must end by a 'universal-server' directory), otherwise found through the default US search paths.

The US-Web installation itself will be looked up relatively to this script, otherwise in the standard path applied by our deploy-us-web-native-build.sh script.

Example: '$0 /opt/test/universal-server' is to read /opt/test/universal-server/us.config.

The ${kill_empd_opt} option allows to kill any EPMD daemon associated to this US-Web instance, provided that it does not run on a standard port (neither the Erlang one, ${erlang_epmd_port}, nor the Myriad one, ${myriad_epmd_port}). Note that any other Erlang application using that daemon would be likely to encouter issues afterwards. This option has been added as if 'systemctl stop' can successfully stop its US-Web instance, it leaves behind its EPMD daemon, which in turn may prevent any subsequent launch of US-Web (with \"Protocol 'inet_tcp': the name us_web@xxx seems to be in use by another Erlang node\").
