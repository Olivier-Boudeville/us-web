-module(us_web_stop_app).

% For exec/0 export:
-include_lib("myriad/include/app_facilities.hrl").

% For update_code_path_for_myriad/0 and all:
-include_lib("myriad/include/myriad_script_include.hrl").



% For trace_aggregator_name:
-include_lib("traces/include/class_TraceAggregator.hrl").

exec() ->

	% No app_start here, hence we need the following (see
	% traces_for_apps:app_start/2 for a detailed explanation):
	%
	erlang:process_flag( trap_exit, false ),

	% First, enable all possible helper code (hence to be done first of all):
	update_code_path_for_myriad_from_module(),

	% Allows to support both OTP conventions and ad hoc, automatic ones:
	wooper_utils:start_for_app(),

	init_from_command_line(),

	% Hardcoded node name:
	TargetNodeName = text_utils:atom_format( "us_web@~s",
											 [ net_utils:localhost() ] ),

	app_facilities:display( "Connecting to node '~s'.", [ TargetNodeName ] ),

	case net_adm:ping( TargetNodeName ) of

		pong ->
			ok;

		pang ->
			trace_utils:error_fmt( "Unable to connect to '~s'.~nIf the target "
				"node is really running and is named exactly like that, check "
				"that the cookies and EPMD ports match and, finally, that "
				"no firewall is in the way (ex: a server may filter the EPMD "
				"port of interest).",
				[ TargetNodeName ] ),

			throw( { unable_to_connect_to, TargetNodeName } )

	end,

	% Otherwise the remote node could not be known before use:
	global:sync(),

	% Rather than finding the US-Web server (whose registered is set in its
	% configuration file) and stopping it, at least currently we simply stop its
	% Erlang node as a whole:

	% All applications are taken down smoothly, all code is unloaded, and all
	% ports are closed before the system terminates by calling halt(Status):
	%
	case rpc:call( TargetNodeName, init, stop, [] ) of

		{ badrpc, Reason } ->
			trace_utils:warning_fmt( "The stopping of node '~s' failed with "
				"following RPC reason: ~p", [ TargetNodeName, Reason ] );

								  [ TargetNodeName ] )

	end,

	% ?app_stop should not be used here as its wait_for_any_trace_supervisor
	% macro would wait for a non-launched supervisor.
	%
	% ?app_stop_without_waiting_for_trace_supervisor() is not used either, as
	% no aggregator was started from that test.
