test_us_web_application( OrderedAppNames ) ->

	test_facilities:display( "Starting the US-Web OTP active application." ),

	% We did not trap EXIT messages, as we wanted this test to crash (thanks to
	% the links below) in case of problem (and not to receive an EXIT message
	% bound not to be read, as it happened when no US configuration file was
	% found).
	%
	% However such tests may crash even when stopping (normally) applications,
	% as apparently an OTP application has its child processes terminated with
	% reason 'shutdown' (not 'normal').
	%
	% So now this test process traps EXIT messages, and ensures that none
	% besides {'EXIT',P,shutdown}, P being the PID of a US-Common process, is
	% received (actually for US-Common no such message is received, unlike for
	% the WOOPER counterpart test case).
	%
	false = erlang:process_flag( trap_exit, true ),

	% We have to link notably to the upcoming US-Web configuration
	% server. However starting an application does not provide a means of
	% knowing its PID (none returned) and this server is not registered under a
	% fixed name, as it may be read from the US-Web configuration file. So this
	% test has also to locate and read that file (for the US counterpart
	% configuration file) in order to determine the name to query:

	{ BinCfgDir, USCfgFilePath, USCfgTable, USCfgRegName, USCfgRegScope } =
		us_common_otp_application_test:get_us_information(),

	% Now we can take care of the US-Web counterpart configuration file:
	{ USWebCfgTable, USWebCfgFilePath } = case
			class_USWebConfigServer:get_configuration_table( USCfgTable,
															 BinCfgDir ) of

		{ ok, P } ->
			P;

		{ error, CfgDiagnosedError } ->
			basic_utils:throw_diagnosed( CfgDiagnosedError, USCfgFilePath )

	end,

	test_facilities:display( "Read US-Web configuration from '~ts'.",
							 [ USWebCfgFilePath ] ),

	{ USWebCfgRegName, USWebCfgRegScope, USWebSchedRegName, USWebSchedRegScope,
	  USWebRegMsg } = case
			class_USWebConfigServer:get_registration_info( USWebCfgTable ) of

		{ ok, Q } ->
			Q;

		{ error, RegDiagnosedError } ->
			basic_utils:throw_diagnosed( RegDiagnosedError )

	end,

	trace_bridge:info( USWebRegMsg ),

	% Now we are able to link to the future US-Web configuration server and
	% scheduler.


	% No ?test_start/?test_stop here, as we start/stop Traces through
	% OTP-related operations.
	%
	% If in batch mode (not in a release, hence no sys.config read here, so only
	% the --batch command-line option matters here), the trace aggregator will
	% record that a trace supervisor is wanted later (iff renamed), otherwise
	% (not in batch mode), no trace supervisor is wanted at all.
	%
	otp_utils:start_applications( OrderedAppNames ),

	% This is fully optional for this US-Web test, yet we prefer also linking to
	% US-related elements:
	%
	USCfgSrvPid = naming_utils:wait_for_registration_of( USCfgRegName,
		naming_utils:registration_to_look_up_scope( USCfgRegScope ) ),

	% The top-level user process may not be aware that an OTP application fails
	% (e.g. because its main process crashed), which is a problem for a test. So
	% here we link explicitly this test process to the US configuration server,
	% to have a chance of detecting issues:
	%
	erlang:link( USCfgSrvPid ),

	% Now linking to the actual US-Web of interest for this test:

	% First the US-Web configuration server:
	USWebCfgSrvPid = naming_utils:wait_for_registration_of( USWebCfgRegName,
		naming_utils:registration_to_look_up_scope( USWebCfgRegScope ) ),

	erlang:link( USWebCfgSrvPid ),

	% Then the US-Web scheduler:

	USWebSchedPid = naming_utils:wait_for_registration_of( USWebSchedRegName,
		naming_utils:registration_to_look_up_scope( USWebSchedRegScope ) ),

	erlang:link( USWebSchedPid ),


	% If not in batch mode, this renaming will trigger the launch of the trace
	% supervisor whose activation was deferred until then:
